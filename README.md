# Budget Tracker
## The Progressive Web Application

### [Project #19][1] for [UCF Coding Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.ce.ucf.edu/coding/)

### Deployed on [Heroku!](https://fudge-it-budgit.herokuapp.com/)

Can be downloaded on mobile or desktop.

Allows users to budget without any connectivity to the web.

This PWA can be downloaded and used offline, then updates when connectivity is returned.

### Implementing 
> `Service Workers`

> `Heroku` Deployment

> `MongoDB` (Mongoose)(`NoSQL`)

> Some `Express`


- Took an existing application and turned it into a PWA
- Hosting on heroku 
- Setup a MongoDB database
- Ensured the app could add and delete entries while offline and update when back online.
