# Budget Tracker Starter Code

[Project #19][1] for 

Deployed on [Heroku!](https://fudge-it-budgit.herokuapp.com/) [UCF Coding Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.ce.ucf.edu/coding/)


Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles users’ financial information.

<blockquote>

## Task

The challenge this week is to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. Once you’ve made these changes, you’ll deploy the application to Heroku.
